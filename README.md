# Social-Media-Insight-using-Naive-Bayes
 we will look at disambiguating the use of the term Python on Twitter's stream. When people talk about Python, they could be talking about the following things: The programming language Python Monty Python, the classic comedy group The snake Python A make of shoe called Python There can be many other things called Python. The aim of our experiment is to take a tweet mentioning Python and determine whether it is talking about the programming language, based only on the content of the tweet.

 Text-based documents contain lots of information. Ex: include books, legal documents, social media, and e-mail. Extracting information from text-based documents is critically important to modern AI systems, for example in search engines, legal AI, and automated news services.Extraction of useful features from text is a difficult problem. Text is not numerical in nature, therefore a model must be used to create features that can be used with data mining algorithms. The good news is that there are some simple models that do a great job at this, including the bag-of-words model.
